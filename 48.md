# split()--->
### At some point, you may need to break a large string down
### into smaller chunks, or strings. This is the opposite of concatenation
### which merges or combines strings into one.


# join()--->
### The join() is a string method which returns a string concatenated with the elements of an iterable
### The join() method takes an iterable - objects capable of returning its members one at a time
### Some of the example of iterables are:
### Native datatypes - List, Tuple, String, Dictionary and Set
### File objects and objects you define with an __iter__() or __getitem()__ method

### It only works on strings and not int or any other data type

# tuple=('8','9','3')
### print ','.join(tuple)
